        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Do you find the normal Kraft Mac and Cheese instructions a little lacking? Well you came to the right place,
            cause our recipe will leave you on your knees begging for more. No longer will you have to take the Kraft Mac
            and Cheese box out of the recycling, or the garbage if you're evil, after accidentally throwing it out
            to check what the instructions are, you can leave it in there to rot. Just one last thing, don't steal this idea
            I'm working on selling this to Kraft, just don't tell anyone it's a secret.
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 boxes Kraft Mac and Cheese</li>
            <li>3 Tablespoons butter (42 grams)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup half and half</li>
            <li>3 ounces American cheese (3 thick slices)</li>
            <li>2 powdered cheese packets (from the Kraft Mac and Cheese boxes)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon onion powder</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the noodles from the boxes and cook until the noodles are tender (according to the package instructions, about 7-8 minutes). Drain the noodles in a colander, and set aside.</li>
            <li>Return the pot to the burner over medium low heat. Add the butter, and swirl until it has melted. Stir in the half and half. Add the American cheese, and stir until melted. Add both cheese packets, the garlic powder, and the onion powder. Stir until fully combined.</li>
            <li>Add the cooked noodles back to the pot, and gently stir until the macaroni is evenly coated.</li>
            <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
